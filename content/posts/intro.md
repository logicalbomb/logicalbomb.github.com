Welcome, dear reader, to the repository of insights and reflections of a mediocre developer. I have been professionally creating software for the web for 14 years and I have come to form an opinion on how certain types of software should be built. Many of these opinions have been formed by trying to accomplish new and challenging tasks and usually failing the first few times. By following these experiences and metrics from their successors I have honed my senses and skills. This has lead me to take on more responsibility, only for me to try even more challenging tasks with more people. Thus the wheel of karma turns.

I hope you find my writings interesting. I _really_ hope that you generally agree with their viewpoint, but if not I am always willing to learn from others! If you would like to contact me about the content of this blog [create an issue here](https://github.com/logicalbomb/logicalbomb.github.io/issues). Enjoy!
